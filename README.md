# paypal_clone

## Description

A design that is based around the website of PayPal. The site contains hidden dropdowns that are displayed using JavaScript. On screen sizes less than 1000px the dropdown menu changes and it appears from the left side of the site instead of appearing from the top. The sections are styled using CSS flexbox and the site is fully responsive from screen sizes greater than 1200px to screens smaller than 440px.

## Demo
